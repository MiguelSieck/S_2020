## Computer and software instructions for the 3D Morphometrics Workshop
**Computer specs:** Please bring a laptop with these suggested specs:
*	A quad-core CPU from last couple years (i7 or i5 is preferred). 
*	1920x1080 or higher screen resolution.
*	8GB or higher RAM (memory)
*	100-200GB available storage space (for software and data). Please note that solid state drives (SSD) both SATA and non-volatile memory express (NVMe) are preferred over spinning hard-drive disks (HDD) due their high sequential read/write performance (usually 10X or more faster than HDDs). 
*	 A discrete (not an integrated one) GPU with minimum of 2GB of RAM with the latest GPU driver installed.  
*	A three-buttoned mouse. 

Your laptop should be running windows 10 (windows 7 has issues and is not supported anymore), or Mac OS 10.11 (El Capitan) or later.  A recent version of a common Linux distribution (like Ubuntu or CentOS) is also fine.
Please note that segmentation is a memory intensive operation. It is suggested, you have 6-10X more memory than your full dataset size (i.e., if you are working on a 1024x1024x1024 dataset, you will need about 10GB RAM to work on in in Slicer). You can always reduce your dataset to match your hardware capacity.

## Required software and data
You should have these software install these on your laptops before coming to workshop.

1.	Please download the latest preview version (v4.11 series) from https://download.slicer.org, and install the SlicerMorph application. 
2. Alternatively, you can install the a precustomized version of 3D Slicer with all the tools we need pre-loaded. Please download it for your OS from http://download.slicermorph.org and follow the instructions in the pdf file.

**Accounts:** Please obtain an account on these websites prior to workshop
*	MorphoSource: https://morphosource.org
*	Slicer Forum, https://discourse.slicer.org (alternatively you can use your github or google accounts to signup)
*	Please sign up for the SlicerMorph announcement to keep up-to-date with SlicerMorph project and extension updates http://mailman11.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/slicermorph-announcements
